# 🔥 Countercurrent Chemical Looping RWGS - Discretized Batch Reactors Simulation

This code simulates chemical-looping RWGS in a 1D plug-flow-like reactor with oxides including LSF and CeO2 based oxides.
It uses a discretizion of the oxide (space) and the gas phase (like time discritization) and then solves a sequential series 
of batch equilibriums over the discritised elements. It is useful for quickly simulating thermodynamic limits.

## 📘 Project Summary

The simulation computes:
- **Reduction phase**: H₂ + oxide → H₂O + reduced oxide
- **Oxidation phase**: CO₂ + reduced oxide → CO + oxide with countercurrent

It tracks:
- Oxygen non-stoichiometry (`δ`)
- Gas compositions (`x_H2O`, `x_CO2`)
- Mass balances over the whole cycle
- Energy balance over the whole cycle

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Set material and operating conditions** in `simulate_cycle()`
2. **Discretize** reactor space (oxide_mesh) and gas flow (gas_mesh)
3. **Run reduction** using `compute_reduction_step()`
4. **Feed reduction output** to `compute_oxidation_step()`
5. **Analyze results** using `calculate_mass_balance()` or visualization routines

---

## 🚀 Quick Example

```python
from main import cycle_until_balanced

results = cycle_until_balanced(
    material="CeO2",
    T=1073,
    x_H2O_0=0.005,
    x_CO2_0=0.995,
    tol=1e-4
)
```

## 📊 Output Format

- `delta_red`, `delta_ox`: non-stoichiometry evolution during reduction and oxidation, arrray with shape = (gas_mesh, oxide_mesh)
- `x_H2O_red`, `x_CO2_ox`: gas mole fractions across reactor grid during reduction and oxidation,  arrray with shape = (gas_mesh, oxide_mesh)
- Use `.T[0]` and `.T[-1]` use slices of the mole fraction arrays to inspect outlet behavior for oxidation [0] and reduction [-1]
