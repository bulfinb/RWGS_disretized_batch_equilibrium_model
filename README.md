# üî• Discretized Redox Reactor Simulation

This code simulates chemical-looping RWGS in a 1D plug-flow-like reactor with oxides including LSF and CeO2 based oxides.
It uses a discretizion of the oxide (space) and the gas phase (like time discritization) and then solves a sequential series 
of batch equilibriums over the discritised elements. It is useful for quickly simulating thermodynamic limits.

## üìò Project Summary

The simulation computes:
- **Reduction phase**: H‚ÇÇ + oxide ‚Üí H‚ÇÇO + reduced oxide
- **Oxidation phase**: CO‚ÇÇ + reduced oxide ‚Üí CO + oxide with countercurrent

It tracks:
- Oxygen stoichiometry (`Œ¥`)
- Gas compositions (`x_H2O`, `x_CO2`)
- Mass balances
- Oxygen chemical potentials in both solid and gas phases

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Set material and operating conditions** in `simulate_cycle()`
2. **Discretize** reactor space (oxide_mesh) and gas flow (gas_mesh)
3. **Run reduction** using `compute_reduction_step()`
4. **Feed reduction output** to `compute_oxidation_step()`
5. **Analyze results** using `calculate_mass_balance()` or visualization routines

---

## üöÄ Quick Example

```python
from main import simulate_cycle

delta_red, x_H2O_red, delta_ox, x_CO2_ox = simulate_cycle(
    material="CeO2",
    T=1073,
    x_H2O_0=0.005,
    x_CO2_0=0.995
)
```

---

## üìä Output Format

- `delta_red`, `delta_ox`: shape = (gas_mesh, oxide_mesh)
- `x_H2O_red`, `x_CO2_ox`: gas mole fractions across reactor grid
- Use `.T[0]` and `.T[-1]` slices to inspect outlet behavior

---

## üß™ Materials Supported

- `CeO2`, `CeO2_simple`
- `CeZr05`, `CeZr15`
- `LSF`
- `CeZr_lowH` (hypothetical low-enthalpy ceria based oxide)

---

## üìê Thermodynamics

- All Œº_O values returned in **kJ/mol**
- Œº_O(gas) from polynomial fits of cantera data and equilibrium expressions
- Œº_O(solid) from literature-derived enthalpy and entropy models
